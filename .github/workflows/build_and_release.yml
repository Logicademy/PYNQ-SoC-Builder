            All the best, Logicademy Team ðŸ˜Ž

            Please Note: This free, open-source application is not digitally signed since code signing certificates cost several hundred dollars annually. When you first run the application, Windows Defender may show a warning message - this is normal for unsigned applications. You can safely proceed by clicking "More info" and then "Run anyway". The source code is available at github.com/Logicademy/PYNQ-SoC-Builder if you'd like to review it or build it yourself.
