            Thank you for checking out the bundled release of PYNQ SoC Builder. This release consists of a single exe file intended for Windows machines.

            Bundled releases are intended for anyone who wishes to give SoC Builder a try for the first time quick and easily.

            Note to Students: It is recommended to clone the repository instead, as this way you will receive new features and improvements as soon as possible over the course of the semester.

            If you encounter any problems, please open an issue or reach out to @lukecanny.

            All the best, Logicademy Team ðŸ˜Ž

            Please Note: This free, open-source application is not digitally signed since code signing certificates cost several hundred dollars annually. When you first run the application, Windows Defender may show a warning message - this is normal for unsigned applications. You can safely proceed by clicking "More info" and then "Run anyway". The source code is available at github.com/Logicademy/PYNQ-SoC-Builder if you'd like to review it or build it yourself.
